# HDF-EOS2
The HDF-EOS2 is a software library designed built on HDF4* to support EOS-specific data structures, 
namely Grid, Point, and Swath. 
The new data structures are constructed from standard HDF data objects, using EOS conventions, through the use of a 
software library. A key feature of HDF-EOS files is that instrument-independent services, such as subsetting by 
geolocation, can be applied to the files across a wide variety of data products.
