The instructions which follow assume that you will be using
the 'zip' files that we provide: hdfeos2_19b.zip (binary file 
for Windows xp) and hdfeos2_19.zip (source code file along with binaries). 
Also we have been using "Microsoft Visual Studio 2008" for our windows 
developement. 


Building from Binary Code Release (hdfeos2_19b.zip)
===============================================
To install the HDFEOS with the prebuilt libraries, it is assumed that 
you have done the following:      

      NOTE: THE FOLLOWING INTSTRUTIONS SHOULD BE FINE FOR xp

      1. Download hdfeos2_19b.zip from 
      ftp://edhs1.gsfc.nasa.gov/edhs/hdfeos/latest_release/windows/, 

      2. On you window, create a directory structure to unpack the 
	source file. For example: 
	F:\					(any drive)
   	MyHDFEOS\				(any folder name)
        

      3. Copy the hdfeos2_19b.zip to that directory and unpack it by running 
	WinZip on it.This should create the following directories: hdfeos, 
	hdf4.2.10_win_x86, jpeg6b-vs2008, zlib128-dll, and 
	szip21-vs2008-noenc (no- encoder) 	

	The libraries and include files for hdfeos2.19 are inside:
	F:\MyHDFEOS\hdfeos\lib		(Release versions of hdfeos and gctp
					libraries (hdfeos.lib, gctp.lib))
					(Debug versions of hdfeos and gctp
					libraries (hdfeosd.lib, gctpd.lib))

	F:\MyHDFEOS\hdfeos\include		( HDFEOS include files )

   	Inside the directories hdf4.2.10_win_x86, jpeg6b-vs2008, zlib128-dll, 
	and szip21-vs2008-noenc ( or szip21-vs2008-enc) you can find their 
	include files and libraries (hd4210.lib, hm4210.lib, xdr.lib, zdll.lib, 
	libjpeg.lib and szlib.lib).

      4. Run your "Microsoft Visual Studio" application.
	
	Assumed you have installed HDF4.2.10 on 
            
	F:\MyHDF\hdf4210-win32\

	To specify the header files and linking in the HDFEOS libraries:
	Select Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->C++Directories->
	"Show directories for"->"Include files", add the following directories:
	
	$(VCInstallDir)include
        $(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\include
        $(WindowsSdkDir)\include
        $(FrameworkSDKDir)include
	F:<path to jpeg>\include  
	F:<path to zlib>\include
	F:<path to szlib>\include      
        F:<path to HDF>\include 
        F:<path to HDFEOS>\include 

	Select Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++Directories->
	"Show directories for"->"Library files", add the following directories:

	$(VCInstallDir)lib
	$(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\lib
	$(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\lib\i386
	$(WindowsSdkDir)\lib
	$(FrameworkSDKDir)lib
	$(VSInstallDir)
	$(VSInstallDir)lib
	F:<path to jpeg>\lib 
	F:<path to zlib>\lib
	F:<path to szlib>\lib
	F:<path to HDF>\lib
	F:<path to HDFEOS>\lib\WIN

	NOTE: Please note that you may need some other include and lib 
	directories, depending on your application. Please see 
	Compile_WIN.readme.txt inside for more details.


Building from Source Code Release (hdfeos2_19.zip)
===============================================

STEP I:  Preconditions

To build the HDFEOS, it is assumed that you have done the following:
      
      1. Installed MicroSoft Visual Studio 2008 (or higher)
    
      2. Installed jpeg, szip and zlib (see install_jpeg_zlib_szip.txt)
	(See step 4)
         
      3. Installed HDF version4.2.10
	(see step 4)
      4. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. For 
      	example: 

	    	F:\				(any drive)
           	MyHDFEOS\			(any folder name)

      5. Copy the source distribution archive to that directory and unpack it 
      using WinZip on hdfeos2_19.zip. Exract all including 'hdfeos2.19'.  The 
      directory hdfeos2.19 will contain hdfeos and 'hdfeos_dev' directories. 
      The directory 'hdfeos_dev' contains several files and directories for 
      Windows, and the 'hdfeos' directory contains hdfeos source code package.

STEP II: Build HDFEOS library

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION           

      1. Open  F:\myHDFEOS\hdfeos_dev\hdfeos.dsw to begin building the 
	 Developer Studio project.
         
      2. Select Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++Directories->
	 "Show directories for"->"Include files", add the following 
	 directories:
               
	 $(VCInstallDir)include
	 $(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\include
	 $(WindowsSdkDir)\include
	 $(FrameworkSDKDir)include
	 F:<path to jpeg>\include  
	 F:<path to zlib>\include
	 F:<path to szlib>\include      
	 F:<path to HDF>\include 
	 F:<path to HDFEOS>\include 

      3. Select Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++Directories->
	 "Show directories for"->"Library files", add the following 
	 directories:

	 F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\x86\Microsoft.VC90.CRT
	 $(VCInstallDir)lib
	 $(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\lib
	 $(VCInstallDir)atlmfc\lib\i386
	 $(WindowsSdkDir)\lib
	 $(FrameworkSDKDir)lib
	 $(VSInstallDir)
	 $(VSInstallDir)lib
	 F:<path to jpeg>\lib 
	 F:<path to zlib>\lib
	 F:<path to szlib>\lib
	 F:<path to HDF>\lib

      4. Select gctp (and once is done repeat for hdfeos) project. On the 
	 Project menu selectProject->Properties.
         Select "General" under "Configuration Properties". In the selection 
	 window for "Configuration Type" select "Static Library(.lib)" option 
	 to create output as library.

	 Select folder C/C++->Preprocesssor.
	 Add the following to "Preprocessor definitions" if they are not there 
	 alraedy: 
	 VISUAL_CPLUSPLUS, INTEL86	 

      5. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Mangger".
	 Select "Debug" in "Active Solution Configuration" window, check mark 
	 hdfeos and gctp build boxes and change Configuration to Debug for both
	 projects.
	 Select "Build" and "Build Solutions" to
	 build the Debug version of the hdfeos and gctp tree.

      6. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Mangger".
	 Select "Release" in "Active Solution Configuration" window, check 
	 mark hdfeos and gctp build boxes and change Configuration to Release 
	 for both projects.
	 Select "Build" and "Build Solutions" to build the Release version 
	 of the hdfeos and gctp tree.

	 Please note that you have a choice of building gctp and hdfeos 
	 separately.

      7. Please check "Release" and "Debug" directories under 
	 F:\myHDFEOS\hdfeos_dev\hdfeos and F:\myHDFEOS\hdfeos_dev\gctp to 
	 make sure that libraries have been created sucessfully.

      8. In command prompt window run the installation batch commands 
	 win32ins.bat
	 in the directory F:\myHDFEOS\hdfeos_dev, Or double click on
	 "F:\myHDFEOS\hdfeos_dev\win32ins.bat" file. This will copy *.lib 
	 files to F:\MyHDFEOS\hdfeos\lib\WIN directory and will remove some 
	 temporary files, debug and release directories, and all other lib 
	 directories under "F:\MyHDFEOS\hdfeos\lib" directory (if they exist).

      9. If you are building an application that uses the HDFEOS library,
	 Please refer to the 
	 <HDFEOS directory>\hdfeos_dev\compile_WIN.readme.txt 
	 file for more information on compiling an application with the 
	 HDFEOS libraries on Windows.
